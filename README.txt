To launch the indexer, run indexer.py.

The index will consist of "document_ids.txt", "index_info.txt", "index_0-9.txt", "index_a-f.txt", "index_g-m.txt",
"index_n-s.txt", and "index_t-z.txt".

To launch the search engine, run search_engine_app.py.

You can access the web interface by going to http://localhost:5000/ on the executing computer. A link to the interface
is also produced in the console when search_engine_app.py is run.
